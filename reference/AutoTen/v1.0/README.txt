Implementation of the AutoTen algorithm as seen in
Evangelos E. Papalexakis, Unsupervised Tensor Mining with Quality Assessment, SIAM SDM 2016.

File demo.m contains an example of executing AutoTen.m and comparing its result to the two baselines of the SDM'16 paper (AutoTenBaseline.m)

In order to use this code, you need to first install the Tensor Toolbox for Matlab, found at http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/
